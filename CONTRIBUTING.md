## Updating Your Fork

Before submitting a pull request, you should ensure that your fork is up to date.

You may fork Laravel Binput:

    git remote add upstream git://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-Binput.git

The first command is only necessary the first time. If you have issues merging, you will need to get a merge tool such as [P4Merge](http://perforce.com/product/components/perforce_visual_merge_and_diff_tools).

You can then update the branch:

    git pull --rebase upstream master
    git push --force origin <branch_name>

Once it is set up, run `git mergetool`. Once all conflicts are fixed, run `git rebase --continue`, and `git push --force origin <branch_name>`.


## Pull Requests

Please review these guidelines before submitting any pull requests.

* When submitting bug fixes, check if a maintenance branch exists for an older series, then pull against that older branch if the bug is present in it.
* Before sending a pull request for a new feature, you should first create an issue with [Proposal] in the title.
* Please follow the [PSR-2 Coding Style](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md) and [PHP-FIG Naming Conventions](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/bylaws/002-psr-naming-conventions.md).
