## THIS ALPHA RELEASE IS FOR TESTING ONLY


## What Is Laravel Binput?

Laravel Binput is an input protector for [Laravel 4](http://laravel.com).  

* Laravel Binput was created by, and is maintained by [Graham Campbell](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell).  
* Laravel Binput relies on my [Laravel Security](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-Security) package.  
* Laravel Binput uses [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-Binput) to run tests to check if it's working as it should.  
* Laravel Binput uses [Scrutinizer CI](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-Binput) to run additional tests and checks.  
* Laravel Binput uses [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) to load and manage dependencies.  
* Laravel Binput provides a [change log](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-Binput/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md), [releases](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-Binput/releases), and a [wiki](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-Binput/wiki).  
* Laravel Binput is licensed under the MIT, available [here](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-Binput/blob/master/LICENSE.md).  


## System Requirements

* PHP 5.3.3+, 5.4+ or PHP 5.5+ is required.
* You will need [Laravel 4](http://laravel.com) because this package is designed for it.  
* You will need [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) installed to load the dependencies of Laravel Binput.  


## Installation

Please check the system requirements before installing Laravel Binput.  

To get the latest version of Laravel Binput, simply require it in your `composer.json` file.

`"graham-campbell/binput": "dev-master"`

You'll then need to run `composer install` or `composer update` to download it and have the autoloader updated.

Once Laravel Binput is installed, you need to register the service provider. Open up `app/config/app.php` and add the following to the `providers` key.

`'GrahamCampbell\Binput\BinputServiceProvider'`

You will also need to have registered the [Laravel Security](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-Security) service provider.

`'GrahamCampbell\Security\SecurityServiceProvider'`

You can register the Binput facade in the `aliases` key of your `app/config/app.php` file if you like.

`'Binput' => 'GrahamCampbell\Binput\Facades\Binput'`


## Updating Your Fork

The latest and greatest source can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-Binput).  
Before submitting a pull request, you should ensure that your fork is up to date.  

You may fork Laravel Binput:  

    git remote add upstream git://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-Binput.git

The first command is only necessary the first time. If you have issues merging, you will need to get a merge tool such as [P4Merge](http://perforce.com/product/components/perforce_visual_merge_and_diff_tools).  

You can then update the branch:  

    git pull --rebase upstream master
    git push --force origin <branch_name>

Once it is set up, run `git mergetool`. Once all conflicts are fixed, run `git rebase --continue`, and `git push --force origin <branch_name>`.
